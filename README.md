Module 14 Challenge

This application builds an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset (http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

All code is original but is based on sample code and documentation found at:
- chatgpt.com: prompted to produce sample code snippets for performing specific functions
- d3js.org: reviewed documentation and code snippets
- plotly.com: reviewed documentation and code snippets
